# Checklists

Checklists are a powerful tool to use when trying to organize your thoughts.  Humans seems to have an innate affinity for lists.  Making lists and checking them off can be very fulfilling.  Checklists can also be used to make sure that steps to repetitive tasks are not forgotten or overlooked.  Checklists can be used to clear your mind, by offloading your tasks onto a list for later reference.

## Checklists as first class citizens in Cosmind

Goal: Facilitate working with checklists, automating much of the tediousness away and letting their utility shine through.

Common use cases:

* TODO List - A list of items that represent tasks that someone might want to get done.  When an item on the list is done, the item should be "checked off" the list.  The ordering of the items may or may not matter.  If ordering matter, it usually is enumerated from first item (top of the list) on to the last item (bottom of the list).  While checked off items are not as important as unchecked items, the user still expects to quickly see what items have been checked off, for example when picking up from where we they left off.

* Grocery List - A list of items to be purchased from the store.  A Grocery list can be collaboratively made, for example, a spouse might make the list and then hand it off to the other spouse.  Since trips to the grocery store are infrequent, a Grocery list might be used on and off over the course of a couple of days.  During this time, quick access is important, so that items can be added as they come to mind.

* Checklist - A list of tasks to be done to ensure that a task is completed successfully.  Ordering may or may not matter, but when it does, it is critical.  Sometimes, certain steps on the checklist might be ordered, while others may not.

* Recipe - Consists of two related lists.  A list of ingredients required to prepare food, and a list of instructions to follow when preparing the food.

Information about checklists:
* Creation date.
* History (changes, updates, removals of items from the list and when that action was done).
* When a checklist is no longer needed (could mean that the list items were all checked off, or the list is no longer relevant), it can be archived.

# Collaboration

Checklists can be shared with others, via various means:
* Shared with other users or groups in the cosmind system
* Shared with anyone that has the link + an optional password.
